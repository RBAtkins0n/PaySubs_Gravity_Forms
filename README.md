## About PaySubs

[PaySubs](https://www.paygate.co.za/paygate-products/paysubs/) allows you to create a recurring (subscription) payment for your Customer. This can be done manually using the PayGate Merchant Portal or your Customer can activate the subscription using an API integration. A Process Now function enables the first transaction to be processed in real-time (when captured via a web site API integration) and the balance to be processed at future dates.
